    "bio": "Transforming your relationship with food for a fuller and healthier life.\n\nAs a Nutritionist, graduated with dedication from the Universidad de la Cuenca del Plata in 2022, my mission goes beyond restrictive diets. I firmly believe that nutritional education is the most powerful tool for lasting and positive change.\n\nMy professional focus specializes in areas where nutrition becomes a key pillar of quality of life:\n\nObesity and Weight Management: I guide you through a comprehensive habit-change process, addressing the multifactorial causes of excess weight. Together, we’ll design a personalized, realistic, and sustainable plan focused on your overall health and well-being, not just the scale.\n\nSports Nutrition: Whether you’re an elite athlete or just looking to optimize your gym performance, I create nutritional strategies adapted to your goals, helping you improve energy, endurance, and recovery.\n\nChild Nutrition and Food Education: I am passionate about building a healthier future generation. I work with children and families to foster a positive relationship with food from childhood, with fun and educational plans tailored to each growth stage, addressing picky eating, childhood overweight, and more.\n\nMy Commitment to You:\n\nMy practice is based on active listening, empathy, and science. I use clear and approachable language, avoiding prohibitions and fostering autonomy. I believe that each person is unique, so your tastes, lifestyle, and goals will be the foundation of your nutrition plan.\n\nI am here to guide, educate, and support you every step of the way toward a healthier and happier version of yourself.\n\nReady to begin? Let’s book a consultation and talk about your goals.",
